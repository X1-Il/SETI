# SETI challenge (Cryptologie)

**An Intriguing Message:**

The SETI program has recently captured a series of messages from the Alpha Centauri star system. The most frequently received message is:

```
541a4231 5d324646 27219a26 12497b0e 724eddcb 0e131617 9521bedf 55544dc7
```

The purpose of the encoding and the reason behind the message are currently unknown. It's possible that the Alpha Centaurians are utilizing this method to assess our cognitive abilities before attempting advanced contact.

**Decoding the Challenge:**

While details regarding the encoding process remain unclear, our best engineers have managed to identify the program likely used by the Alpha Centaurians. This program takes two inputs:

* **Size:** An integer representing the message length.
* **Array a:** An array of size `size / 16` containing the encoded message.

The program then outputs an array of size `size / 16` containing the decoded message. Each element in both the input and output arrays should be displayed in hexadecimal format, padded with leading zeros to ensure 8 characters (e.g., `42` would be displayed as `0000002a`).

**The Task Ahead:**

The challenge lies in deciphering the original `array a` from the provided encoded `array b`. Notably, if multiple possible decodings exist, your program should display all possibilities in alphabetical order.

This is a complex task, and we believe it takes a true NERD to crack this code!

**Further Information:**

* **Due to the complexity and potential variations in the specific challenge details, including the pseudo-code description and a link to the C++ program might not be universally applicable.** 
* We encourage you to consult the provided information and resources as a starting point for your research and development of your program.
* The goal remains to create a program which, given the encoded message (`array b`), can find the original input (`array a`). 

## SETI Program: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence

The SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program is a scientific endeavor dedicated to answering the age-old question: **Are we alone in the universe?** Its primary mission is to detect signals that could be created by intelligent life beyond Earth.

**How does SETI work?**

SETI researchers primarily focus on analyzing **electromagnetic signals**, such as radio waves, that could potentially be created by advanced technology. They use powerful telescopes and sophisticated algorithms to scan these signals for any patterns or anomalies that might indicate artificial origin.

**Different approaches within SETI:**

The program employs two main approaches:

* **Targeted Search:** This approach focuses on specific stars or regions in space considered more likely to harbor planets capable of supporting life.
* **Untargeted Search:** This approach scans a broader range of the sky without focusing on specific areas.

**Challenges of SETI:**

Despite its best efforts, SETI faces several challenges:

* **The vastness of the universe:** Finding signals from potential extraterrestrial civilizations is extremely difficult due to the immense size and number of stars and galaxies.
* **Uncertainty about signal characteristics:** We have no clear idea about the specific type of signals an advanced civilization might choose to broadcast, making detection even more challenging.
* **False positives:** Natural phenomena can sometimes appear to be artificial signals, requiring careful analysis to avoid misinterpretations.

**Significance of SETI:**

Despite these challenges, the SETI program remains a vital scientific endeavor for several reasons:

* **Understanding our place in the universe:** By searching for intelligent life elsewhere, we gain a deeper understanding of our own place in the cosmos and the potential for life beyond our planet.
* **Expanding our knowledge of the universe:** The search for extraterrestrial intelligence pushes the boundaries of our scientific understanding and knowledge about the universe's potential for life.

While no confirmed signs of extraterrestrial intelligence have been found yet, the ongoing research through SETI is crucial in our quest to understand the vast universe and our existence within it.
